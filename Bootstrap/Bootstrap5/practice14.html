    <div class="one"><p>In our urban and suburban houses what should we do 
      without cats? In our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and
      storerooms, our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our granaries, 
      our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat markets, and other places 
      too numerous to mention, how useful they are! In our ships, however, the rats oft
       set them at defiance; still they are of great service.</p></div>
    <div class="two"><h1>Adevert!</h1></div>
    <div class="three"><p>How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats 
      or mice, awaiting their egress from their place of refuge or that which is their 
      home! How well Shakespeare in Pericles, Act iii., describes this keen attention 
      of the cat to its natural pursuit!</p></div>
    <div class="four"><h1>Another lovely advert!</h1></div>
    <div class="five"><p>A slight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth; a quick, sharp, 
      resolute motion, and the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any one have a plague 
      of rats and mice, as I once had, and let them be delivered therefrom by cats, as I was, 
      and they will have a lasting and kind regard for them.</p></div>
